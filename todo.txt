lazy load as much javascript as possible

serve images scaled to their appropriate size

lazy load images below the fold or expensive and less-important

For small columns, reload images to fill space in mobile layout? Lazy load all post thumbnails and let javascript figure out which to load?

Use thumbnail height based on column placement, not fixed

homepage layout which allows for mix of image/content/lists/carousels. maybe have a top bucket for newest content, then one for key categories, and fill out the rest with the last week of material with a day per row of elements
	add option to hide from homepage?
	priority option to push elements left (important) or right (unimportant)?
	I GOT IT LOL
		sort before column split by priority
		sort after column split by reverse chronological but GROUP BY DAY, not absolute time, so more important stories will still be above others despite publishing order
		horizontal axis is importance, vertical axis is freshness

Ubiquitous use of WordPress transients API to minimize queries

homepage setup with option to select the categories the homepage draws from

category/tag pages which show highlights based on post priority
